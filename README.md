# mech-mouse-jiggler

A very impractical and stupid mouse jiggler using a crank mechanism, 12V DC motor, and a PWM circuit.

## Purpose

I wanted a basic project with some gears, a mechanical movement, and a DC motor. 
So this was the simplest thing I could think of; Move a mouse back and forth.

The mechanical movement and gears gave me more experience with components/joints in Fusion 360.
I also took the opportunity to learn KiCad and design a PCB for my basic PWM circuit.

## Finished Project

Definitely not perfect and I kept finding flaws. But, it was good enough for the project scope I made.
